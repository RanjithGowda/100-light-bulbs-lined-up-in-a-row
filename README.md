100 light bulbs lined up in a row | Simple solution in C

# Question:
You have 100 light bulbs lined up in a row. You walk past them and turn them all on in the first pass. Then, starting at the same end, you go along and switch every other light bulb off so all even-numbered light bulbs are now turned off.

Now, you go back again and switch every third light bulb. But, any light bulb that is off is turned back on, and any light bulb that is on, is turned off.

You go back again and switch every fourth bulb, if it is on, turn it off and vice-versa.

Then you repeat this process for every fifth bulb, and every sixth bulb and so on up to 100 passes.

# Solution:

The output is a series of binary numbers representing the ON(1) and OFF(0) state of the bulbs.
